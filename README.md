# Firefly III Sankey Diagram generator

## Introduction

A sankey diagram is a diagram that shows you the flow of things. In this case, money! Here's an example. The categories and budget labels are Dutch, sorry about that. Feel free to submit a better example!

## Generate your own diagram

This tool uses the [Firefly III](https://www.firefly-iii.org/) [API](https://api-docs.firefly-iii.org/) to generate such a diagram for you. You can tune it by excluding accounts, budgets and categories. Optionally, you can generate a diagram that includes all destination accounts (but this gets messy very quickly).

You can download and install the tool yourself or use the **[online version](https://sankey.firefly-iii.org/)**.

There is no Docker image and no installation instructions, I just built this tool for the fun of it.
